## Explanation:

This project is on implement the A* algorithm to find the route between two node in a given graph.


I used a minHeap to keep track of the optimal node. minHeap also time efficient. Time complexity for adding an element to minHeap is O(logn).

I have taken heuristic as the ecludian distance between two nodes.

In order to see the algorithm work download this repository and run the project_notebook.ipynb file in jupyter notebook. The actual implementation is in the student_code.py  Major test cases are in the test.py file
